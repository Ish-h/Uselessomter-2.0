Project Description
Uselessometer 2.0 is a highly advanced, totally unnecessary AI-powered device that measures just how useless your project really is ‚Äî with style, sarcasm, and sparkles ‚ú®. It gives you a Uselessness Score and even prints you a useless certificate of mediocrity.
The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How do you scientifically prove that your friend‚Äôs hackathon idea is complete trash? There‚Äôs no certified way to measure ‚ÄúWow, this is pointless‚Äù ‚Äî until now.
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI-powered system that rates your idea on Actual Usefulness, Overthinking Quotient, Trashiness, and other life-changing metrics. It then generates a roast, a fake certificate, and maybe a therapy recommendation for extremely useless ideas.
