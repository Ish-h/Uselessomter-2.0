# **Uselessometer 2.0** üéØ

## **Basic Details**
- **Team Name**: The Solo Useless Hero
- **Team Members**: 
  - **Team Lead**: Isha Hussian - Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology

## **Project Description**
**Uselessometer 2.0** is a highly advanced, totally unnecessary AI-powered device that measures just how useless your project really is ‚Äî with style, sarcasm, and sparkles ‚ú®. It gives you a **Uselessness Score** and even prints you a useless certificate of mediocrity.

## **The Problem (that doesn't exist)**
How do you scientifically prove that your friend‚Äôs hackathon idea is complete trash? There‚Äôs no certified way to measure ‚ÄúWow, this is pointless‚Äù ‚Äî until now.

## **The Solution (that nobody asked for)**
We built an AI-powered system that rates your idea on **Actual Usefulness**, **Overthinking Quotient**, **Trashiness**, and other life-changing metrics. It then generates a roast, a fake certificate, and maybe a therapy recommendation for extremely useless ideas.
