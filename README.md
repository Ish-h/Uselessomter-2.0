## Project Description
Uselessometer 2.0 is a highly advanced, totally unnecessary AI-powered device that measures just how useless your project really is ‚Äî with style, sarcasm, and sparkles ‚ú®. It gives you a **Uselessness Score** and even prints you a useless certificate of mediocrity.  

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How do you *scientifically* prove that your friend‚Äôs hackathon idea is complete trash?  
There‚Äôs no certified way to measure ‚ÄúWow, this is pointless‚Äù ‚Äî until now.  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI-powered system that rates your idea on **Actual Usefulness**, **Overthinking Quotient**, **Trashiness**, and other life-changing metrics.  
It then generates a roast, a fake certificate, and maybe a therapy recommendation for *extremely useless* ideas.
